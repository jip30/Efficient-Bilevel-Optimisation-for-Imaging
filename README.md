# Efficient-Bilevel-Optimisation-for-Imaging
Code for the Interdisciplinary research Project "Efficient Bilevel Optimisation for Imaging" as part of the curriculum for SAMBa cohort 7. This project looked at recycling Krylov methods and inexact gradient methods to improve the efficiency of using bilevel optimisation to learn multiple parameters in variational image reconstruction models.
